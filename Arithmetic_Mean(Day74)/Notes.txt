Topic: Arithmetic Mean (Average)
Types of Mean
There are three types of mean:

Arithmetic Mean (most commonly used)
Geometric Mean
Harmonic Mean

When we just say "mean," we usually refer to arithmetic mean.

Arithmetic Mean for Ungrouped Data
Formula:
Mean (x̄) = Sum of all observations / Number of observations
Mean (x̄) = (x₁ + x₂ + x₃ + ... + xₙ) / n
Example:
Data: 54, 29, 31, 46, 40
Mean = (54 + 29 + 31 + 46 + 40) / 5 = 200 / 5 = 40

Important Property: Deviation from Mean
Deviation = Each observation - Mean
For the above example (Mean = 40):

54 - 40 = +14
29 - 40 = -11
31 - 40 = -9
46 - 40 = +6
40 - 40 = 0

Key Property: The sum of all deviations from the mean always equals zero.
(+14) + (-11) + (-9) + (+6) + 0 = 0
This is a fundamental property to verify your calculations!

Arithmetic Mean for Grouped Data
Grouped data = Data organized by frequency (how many times each value appears)
Formula:
Mean (x̄) = Σ(xᵢ × fᵢ) / Σfᵢ
Where:

xᵢ = each unique value
fᵢ = frequency (how many times that value appears)

Example:
Value (xᵢ)Frequency (fᵢ)xᵢ × fᵢ1077015812045209109061060
Mean = (70 + 120 + 20 + 90 + 60) / (7 + 8 + 5 + 10 + 10)
Mean = 360 / 40 = 9

Special Properties of Arithmetic Mean
If you perform the same operation on all observations, apply the same operation to the mean:

Addition: Add 2 to all values → Add 2 to the mean

New mean = 40 + 2 = 42


Subtraction: Subtract 3 from all values → Subtract 3 from the mean

New mean = 40 - 3 = 37


Multiplication: Multiply all values by 2 → Multiply mean by 2

New mean = 40 × 2 = 80


Division: Divide all values by 5 → Divide mean by 5

New mean = 40 ÷ 5 = 8




Summary

Arithmetic Mean = Average of all values
For ungrouped data: Add all values and divide by count
For grouped data: Use frequency-weighted average
Deviations always sum to zero (important verification tool)
Operations on all data values affect the mean the same way
