Background & Creation
Creator: Walter Bright

American computer scientist
Founded Digital Mars company
Expertise in compiler design and creation
Published journals on compiler-related topics
Previously created C/C++ compilers and games

Development Timeline:

Started development in 1999
First release (Version 1) in 2001
Version 1 continued until 2007 (known as D1)
D2 was later introduced and became the standard
Now referred to as D, D Lang, or D2

Design Philosophy
Initial Goal: Re-engineer C++

Later evolved into a distinct language
Drew inspiration from multiple languages: Java, Python, Ruby, C#
Aimed for better performance than C++
Emphasized safety and productivity

Key Technical Features
Language Classification:

General-purpose system-level programming language
Statically typed (like C)
Compiled language (converts source code directly to machine code)
Multi-paradigm supporting:

Object-oriented programming
Imperative programming
Procedural programming
Functional programming



Memory Management:

Manual memory management (like C++)
Garbage collection option available

Syntax & Structure:

C-like syntax
Module system (eliminates need for header files)
Modules can be compiled separately
Libraries can be linked at runtime
Generates executables

Interoperability:

Can collaborate with C++ code
Modern programming constructs included

Why D Language Didn't Become Popular
Major Reasons:

Lack of Corporate Backing

No major company support
Maintained by D Software Foundation (non-profit)
Limited resources compared to corporate-backed languages


Small Community

Not in TIOBE Index Top 20
Community support insufficient
Much smaller than popular language communities


Limited Commercial Adoption

Not prominent in large commercial applications
Fewer real-world use cases


No Killer Feature

Despite many features, no unique standout feature
No compelling reason for developers to switch


Ecosystem Limitations

Libraries not as rich/comprehensive
Limited tooling support
Smaller third-party ecosystem



Key Takeaway
Despite being technically sound with better performance and safety goals than C++, D couldn't achieve popularity due to non-technical factors: corporate support, community size, and ecosystem development. Multiple compilers exist and the community is active, but these weren't enough to compete with established languages.
Broader Industry Context

Over 1,000 programming languages exist
Only ~10 languages dominate the market
Occasionally a "hero language" emerges (like Python, Java in their time)
Modern competition makes it harder for new languages to gain traction
Technical merit alone doesn't guarantee success
