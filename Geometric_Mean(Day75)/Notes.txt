Three Types of Mean
There are three types of mean:

Arithmetic Mean 
Geometric Mean 
Harmonic Mean 

What is Geometric Mean?
Simple Formula: Multiply all values together, then take the nth root (where n = number of observations)
Example with 5 numbers:
Numbers: 4, 16, 128, 512, 1024
Calculation:

Multiply all: 4 × 16 × 128 × 512 × 1024
Take the 5th root (or raise to power 1/5)

Easier method using powers of 2:

4 = 2², 16 = 2⁴, 128 = 2⁷, 512 = 2⁹, 1024 = 2¹⁰
Add exponents: 2 + 4 + 7 + 9 + 10 = 32
So: 2³² raised to power 1/5 = 2^(32/5) = 2^6.4
Answer ≈ 84.44

Important Rule
Geometric mean only works with positive numbers (negative numbers would create complex numbers when taking roots)
When to Use Geometric Mean vs Arithmetic Mean?
Real-World Example: Stock Market Investment
Scenario:

You invest ₹100
Year 1: +50% profit → You now have ₹150
Year 2: -50% loss → You now have ₹75

Final result: You lost ₹25 (25% loss overall)
Why Arithmetic Mean Fails Here:
If you calculate: (+50% + (-50%)) ÷ 2 = 0%
This suggests no change, but you actually lost money! The arithmetic mean overestimates and gives a misleading result.
How Geometric Mean Solves This:
Step 1: Convert percentages to decimal multipliers

Year 1: 1.5 (represents 50% gain)
Year 2: 0.5 (represents 50% loss)

Step 2: Apply geometric mean formula

√(1.5 × 0.5) = √0.75 ≈ 0.866

Step 3: Subtract 1 to get the rate

0.866 - 1 = -0.134 or -13.4% per year

Verification:

Start: ₹100
After Year 1 (13.4% loss): ₹86.6
After Year 2 (13.4% loss on ₹86.6): ≈ ₹75 ✓

This accurately shows you're losing about 13.4% per year on average, which makes sense!
Key Takeaway
Use Geometric Mean when:

Dealing with rates of change, growth rates, or percentages
Values are multiplied together (compound interest, investment returns)
You need accurate average rates over time

Use Arithmetic Mean when:

Adding values together
Finding simple averages of independent observations

Geometric mean always gives a value smaller than or equal to arithmetic mean, and it's more accurate for multiplicative processes like investment returns!
