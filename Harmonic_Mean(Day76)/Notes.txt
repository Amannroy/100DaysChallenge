Harmonic Mean

Formula
For values x₁, x₂, x₃, ... xₙ:
Harmonic Mean = n / (1/x₁ + 1/x₂ + ... + 1/xₙ)

Take reciprocals (1/value) of all numbers
Add them up
Divide total count by this sum


Key Rule
For the same data:
Harmonic Mean < Geometric Mean < Arithmetic Mean
(Harmonic mean is always the smallest)

When to Use Harmonic Mean?
Use it when dealing with rates and ratios (speed, efficiency, etc.)
Classic Example: Average Speed Problem
Question: You travel from point A to B at 40 km/hr, and return from B to A at 60 km/hr. What's your average speed?
Wrong Answer: (40 + 60) / 2 = 50 km/hr ❌
Right Answer: Use Harmonic Mean = 48 km/hr ✓

Why Arithmetic Mean is Wrong Here
Let's say distance A to B = 120 km

Going (A→B): 40 km/hr → takes 3 hours
Returning (B→A): 60 km/hr → takes 2 hours

Total distance: 240 km
Total time: 5 hours
Average speed: 240/5 = 48 km/hr
The Key Insight:

Distance is same both ways, but time is different (3 hrs vs 2 hrs)
You spent MORE time at the slower speed
So average is closer to 40 than to 60

Use Arithmetic Mean only when TIME is equal in all parts

When NOT to Use Harmonic Mean

When any value is zero (can't divide by zero)
When time periods are equal (use arithmetic mean instead)
When not dealing with rates/ratios


For Grouped Data (with frequencies)
If values have frequencies (f₁, f₂, etc.):
Harmonic Mean = Σf / (f₁/x₁ + f₂/x₂ + ...)

Real Application in Data Science
F1 Score in Machine Learning uses Harmonic Mean!

Used in classification models with imbalanced data
Combines Precision and Recall using harmonic mean (not arithmetic)


Quick Summary
✅ Use Harmonic Mean for: Rates, speeds, ratios (when denominators matter)
❌ Don't use when: Values are zero, or time/quantities are equal
🔑 Remember: It's always the lowest of the three means
