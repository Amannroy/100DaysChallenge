Understanding Range in Statistics 📊
What is Dispersion?
Central Tendency vs Dispersion:

Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode) = Gives us ONE number to represent entire dataset

Example: "Average class marks = 75"


Dispersion = Tells us HOW SPREAD OUT the data is

Are all students scoring near 75? Or are scores all over the place?



Range - The Simplest Measure
Formula:
Range = Maximum Value - Minimum Value
Example Given:

Dataset: 17, 23, 45, 52, 67, 81
Smallest value (Xmin) = 17
Largest value (Xmax) = 81
Range = 81 - 17 = 64

This means data is spread across 64 units.
The BIG Problem with Range ⚠️
Range only looks at the two extreme values (highest and lowest). It ignores everything in between!
Why this is bad:

Imagine: 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 81
Most data is clustered between 17-22
But ONE outlier (81) makes it seem like data is super spread out
Range = 64 (misleading!)

Real situation: 99% of data is tightly grouped, but range doesn't show this.

Standard Deviation ⭐ (Most important!)
Variance

Key Takeaway
Range is simple but not useful for real analysis because it can be misleading when outliers exist.
