Interquartile Range (IQR) - Simple Notes
Why We Need IQR?
Problem with Range:

Range only looks at extreme values (max - min)
Example: If data is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 100]

Range = 100 - 1 = 99
But most data is between 1-10, only one outlier at 100
Range doesn't show data is actually clustered!



What are Quartiles? (Quick Recap)
Quartiles divide sorted data into 4 equal parts:

Q1 (Lower Quartile): 25% of data is below this
Q2 (Median): 50% of data is below this (middle value)
Q3 (Upper Quartile): 75% of data is below this

Formulas:

Q1 position = (n+1)/4
Q2 position = (n+1)/2
Q3 position = 3(n+1)/4

Where n = total number of values
When You Get Decimals:
If position = 2.25, it means between 2nd and 3rd term

Take 2nd term value + 0.25 × (3rd term - 2nd term)

Interquartile Range (IQR)
Formula: IQR = Q3 - Q1
Why it's better:

Focuses on middle 50% of data
Ignores extreme values (outliers)
More robust measure of spread

Example Problem:
Data: 13, 18, 35, 19, 21, 22, 20, 23
Step 1: Sort the data
13, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 35
Step 2: Find Q1

n = 8, so position = (8+1)/4 = 2.25
Q1 = 18 + 0.25(19-18) = 18.25

Step 3: Find Q3

Position = 3(9)/4 = 6.75
Q3 = 22 + 0.75(23-22) = 22.75

Step 4: Calculate IQR

IQR = 22.75 - 18.25 = 4.5

Outliers Detection
Values are outliers if they fall outside:

Below: Q1 - 1.5 × IQR
Above: Q3 + 1.5 × IQR

Other Related Measures
1. Semi-Interquartile Range (Quartile Deviation)
Formula: (Q3 - Q1)/2
Simply half of IQR
2. Coefficient of Quartile Deviation
Formula: (Q3 - Q1)/(Q3 + Q1)
Why this is important:

Unitless (no units attached)
Can compare different datasets
It's a relative measure, not absolute

Absolute vs Relative Values - Example:

Student A: 46/50 marks
Student B: 72/100 marks

Absolute values say B is better (72 > 46)
But relative: A = 92%, B = 72% → A is actually better!
Same logic applies to IQR - use coefficient for comparing datasets!

Summary

MEASURES SUMMARY
IQR (Interquartile Range)
Formula: Q3 - Q1
Type: Absolute measure
Use: Shows the spread of middle 50% of data
Quartile Deviation (Semi-Interquartile Range)
Formula: (Q3 - Q1)/2
Type: Absolute measure
Use: Half of IQR, another way to express spread
Coefficient of Quartile Deviation
Formula: (Q3 - Q1)/(Q3 + Q1)
Type: Relative measure
Use: Used to compare dispersion between different datasets because it's unitless
