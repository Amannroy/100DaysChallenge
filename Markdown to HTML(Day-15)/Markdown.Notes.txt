📘 Markdown to HTML Converter — Concept Overview
✅ What This Project Does

This project converts a Markdown (.md) file into an HTML (.html) file using Python.
It helps understand file handling, virtual environments, and Python libraries in a simple and practical way.

🔍 Key Concepts & Knowledge
📄 What is Markdown?

A lightweight markup language used for writing formatted text using plain text.

Commonly used in GitHub README files, documentation, blogs, etc.

Example formats: # Heading, **bold**, - lists, tables, checkboxes, etc.

🌐 What is HTML?

The standard language for creating web pages.

Markdown is simpler but needs to be converted into HTML to be displayed by browsers.

⚙️ How the Conversion Works (Conceptually)

Read the Markdown file (.md)

Convert its syntax to HTML using a library (like markdown in Python)

Save the converted content into an HTML (.html) file

Result: A web-ready HTML page generated from simple Markdown text.

💡 Why Use a Virtual Environment?

Keeps your project dependencies isolated from other projects.

Prevents conflicts between different versions of installed libraries.

Considered a best practice in Python development.

📦 Library Used

markdown (Python library)

Converts Markdown syntax to HTML.

Example: # Title → <h1>Title</h1>

Must be installed before running the script: pip install markdown

🗂 Folder Structure (Concept)
Project Folder/
│
├── workspace/        → Virtual environment (auto-generated)
├── sample.md         → Input Markdown file
├── md_to_html.py     → Converter script
└── output.html       → Generated output file

⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions (Conceptually)
Problem	Why It Happens	Solution
No module named 'markdown'	Library not installed in venv	Install using pip install markdown
FileNotFoundError	Wrong file path or missing file	Ensure .py and .md are in same folder
Script runs but no output.html created	Error hidden in try-except block	Print actual error to debug
