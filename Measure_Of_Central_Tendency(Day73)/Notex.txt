What's the Problem?
Imagine you have 100 students who took an exam. You have 100 different marks. Now, if someone asks "How did the class perform?", you can't just say "good" - that's too vague. You need a single number to represent the entire group's performance.
What is Central Tendency?
Central Tendency = Finding ONE representative value for a whole dataset
Think of it like finding the "center" or "average" of your data.
Real-Life Analogy
Example 1: Balancing a Pen

A regular pen balances exactly at its middle point
That middle point represents the "center"

Example 2: Baseball Bat

A baseball bat is heavier on one end
To balance it, you can't hold it at the exact middle
You need to hold it closer to the heavier side
This shows there are different ways to find the "center" depending on your purpose

Three Main Methods
1. Mean (Average)

Add all values and divide by how many there are
Three types: Arithmetic, Geometric, Harmonic

2. Median (Middle Value)

Arrange data in order, pick the middle value

3. Mode (Most Frequent)

The value that appears most often in your data

Important Relationships
When all three are EQUAL (Mean = Median = Mode):

Your data is symmetrical (balanced on both sides)
Like a perfect bell curve

When Mean > Median > Mode:

Positively skewed data (tail stretches to the right)

When Mean < Median < Mode:

Negatively skewed data (tail stretches to the left)

Bonus Formula
If you know any TWO of these values, you can find the third:
Mode = 3 × Median - 2 × Mean

Bottom Line: Instead of dealing with hundreds of different numbers, we use these measures to get ONE number that represents the entire dataset - making it easy to compare and understand data!
