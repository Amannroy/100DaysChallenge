Measures of Dispersion 
What We Already Learned

Measures of Central Tendency give us ONE single value to represent entire data
Examples: Mean, Median, Mode
Like: Average height of students, per capita income of a country

The Problem with Averages
Example: India's Per Capita Income

Average income: ₹2 lakhs per year
Sounds okay, right? But wait...
Some people earn WAY more (rich people earn ₹2 lakhs per DAY!)
Some people earn WAY less (less than ₹50,000 per year)

The Issue: Average alone doesn't show the full picture! We're missing something important.
What is Dispersion?
Dispersion = Spread of Data
It tells us:

How scattered is the data?
How clustered is the data?
Are values close together or far apart?

Why Dispersion Matters
Low Dispersion (Good News!)

Data is clustered together
Average truly represents the whole dataset
Everyone earns close to ₹2 lakhs → no major inequality

High Dispersion (Red Flag!)

Data is scattered all over
Average is misleading!
Huge gap between rich and poor → government needs to make policies

Key Concept (Very Important!)
Dispersion is ALWAYS calculated with respect to an average (center value)

You first pick your center: Mean, Median, or Mode
Then measure how far each value is from that center
More distance = More dispersion


4 Measures of Dispersion

Range - Simplest method
Quartile Deviation (Inter-Quartile Range)
Standard Deviation ⭐
Variance ⭐

Note: Standard Deviation and Variance are the MOST IMPORTANT and most effective
Why This Matters for Data Science & AI

Data Science and AI work with HUGE amounts of data
Understanding both center (average) and spread (dispersion) is essential
You need stats to play with data effectively!


Bottom Line: Don't just ask "What's the average?" Also ask "How spread out is the data?" Both together give you the complete picture! 📊
