MySQL vs SQLite:
Main Difference
MySQL = Has a separate server running all the time (like a restaurant with waiters)
SQLite = Just a single file, no server needed (like your personal lunchbox)

Architecture
MySQL:

Runs as a separate process called MySQL Server
Your app talks to the server, server manages the database
Needs network connection (TCP/IP)
App → MySQL Server → Database

SQLite:

Just one database file
Your app directly reads/writes to the file
No separate process running
App → Database File (direct access)


Setup & Installation
MySQL:

Needs proper installation
Requires configuration
More complex setup


SQLite:

Zero configuration
Just need the database file
Super simple, ready to use


Multiple Users (Concurrency)
MySQL:

Many users can read and write at the same time
Handles this safely with locking systems
Perfect for busy applications

SQLite:

Many users can READ together
Only ONE user can WRITE at a time
Others must wait or fail


When to Use What
Use MySQL when:

Building websites with many users
Expect high traffic
Need multiple people writing data simultaneously
Building large applications (e-commerce, social media, banking)
Database will grow big

Use SQLite when:

Building mobile apps
Making desktop software
Single user or low traffic
Limited resources (IoT devices)
Need something simple and lightweight
Testing/prototyping


Scalability
MySQL:

Can handle millions of users
Supports huge databases
Built for growth

SQLite:

Good for small scale only
Limited by file system
Not for high traffic


Simple Rule
Think of MySQL as a public bus - built for many passengers, runs on schedule, needs maintenance
Think of SQLite as a bicycle - personal, simple, lightweight, no maintenance
Neither is "better" - use the right tool for the job!

Key Takeaway
MySQL = Server-based, powerful, for big multi-user apps
SQLite = File-based, simple, for small single-user apps
Choose based on your needs, not which is "better"!
