Percentiles 
What is a Percentile?
Percentile = Values that divide a dataset into 100 equal parts

Similar to quartiles (which divide into 4 parts), but percentiles divide into 100 parts
Range: P₀ to P₁₀₀

Understanding Percentile Values

P₁ = 1% of data is below this value
P₅₀ = 50% of data is below this value (this is the median or Q₂)
P₁₀₀ = highest value

Connection to Quartiles

Q₁ = P₂₅ (25% of data below)
Q₂ = P₅₀ (median)
Q₃ = P₇₅ (75% of data below)

Formula to Calculate Percentile
Position of Pᵢ = (i/100) × (n + 1)
Where:

i = percentile number (like 10 for P₁₀)
n = total number of values

Step-by-Step Example: Finding P₁₀
Given data: 10 values (unsorted)
Step 1: Find the position

P₁₀ = (10/100) × (10 + 1)
P₁₀ = 0.1 × 11 = 1.1
This means P₁₀ is between 1st and 2nd position

Step 2: Sort the data first!
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always arrange data in ascending order before finding the actual value
Step 3: Calculate the actual value

Position 1.1 means: between 1st value (17) and 2nd value (20)
Gap between them = 20 - 17 = 3
Take 10% of this gap = 3 × 0.1 = 0.3
Add to first value: 17 + 0.3 = 17.3

Answer: P₁₀ = 17.3
Key Points to Remember

Always sort data first before calculating percentile values
The formula gives you the position, not the value
If position is decimal (like 1.1), interpolate between the two nearest values
Percentiles help understand data distribution better than just percentages
