Topic: Understanding Python Soft Keywords ðŸ’¡

What I Learned:

Hard keywords (like if, for, while) are always reserved.

Soft keywords act as keywords only in specific contexts â€” outside those, you can use them as normal variable names.

ðŸ§© Soft Keywords in Python

Keyword	Introduced In	Used For	Can Be Variable Name?
match	Python 3.10	Match-case statement	âœ… Yes
case	Python 3.10	Pattern matching	âœ… Yes
_	Python 3.10	Default (catch-all) case	âœ… Yes
type	Python 3.12	Type aliases	âœ… Yes

Example

# âœ… Soft keywords as normal variables
match = "I'm a variable"
case = "Me too"
type = "I'm also a variable"
print(match, case, type)

# âœ… Soft keywords used as keywords
action = "start"
match action:
    case "start":
        print("Starting the program")
    case "stop":
        print("Stopping the program")
    case _:
        print("Unknown command")


Output

I'm a variable Me too I'm also a variable
Starting the program


Why Itâ€™s Important:
Soft keywords make Python flexible and backward-compatible â€” older code wonâ€™t break even when new keywords are added.
