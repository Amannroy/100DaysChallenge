Topic: The Walrus Operator — introduced in Python 3.8

What It Does:

Assigns a value and uses it in the same expression.

Avoids repeating the same code twice.

Example 1 — Input Loop

# Without Walrus
data = input("Enter data: ")
while data != "quit":
    print(data)
    data = input("Enter data: ")

# With Walrus
while (data := input("Enter data: ")) != "quit":
    print(data)


Sample Run

Enter data: Monday
Monday
Enter data: Tuesday
Tuesday
Enter data: quit


Example 2 — List Comprehension

words = ["apple", "bat", "cat"]
numbers = [n := len(word) for word in words if n > 3]
print(numbers)


Output

[5]  # Only "apple" has length > 3


Why It’s Useful:
Makes code concise and readable by combining assignment and evaluation in one line.
