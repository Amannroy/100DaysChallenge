Quartiles in Statistics 
What are Quartiles?
Quartiles are values that divide a sorted dataset into four equal parts. They are special types of quantiles used to understand data distribution and spread.
The Five Quartile Points
When we divide data into four equal parts, we get 5 boundary points:

Q0 = Minimum value (0% of data)
Q1 = First Quartile (25% of data below it)
Q2 = Second Quartile/Median (50% of data below it)
Q3 = Third Quartile (75% of data below it)
Q4 = Maximum value (100% of data)

Note: We typically only calculate Q1, Q2, and Q3 since Q0 and Q4 are just the extreme values.
Why Use Quartiles?
Unlike range (which only considers extreme values), quartiles help us understand:

How data is spread throughout the distribution
The detailed structure of data dispersion
Patterns in different sections of the dataset

This makes quartiles a much better measure of dispersion than simple range.
How to Calculate Quartiles
Step-by-Step Method
Example Dataset: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 25 (already sorted)
Step 1: Find the total number of elements

n = 11 elements

Step 2: Calculate Q2 (Median)

Formula for odd n: Position = (n + 1) / 2
Position = (11 + 1) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6th term
Q2 = 10 (the 6th value)

Step 3: Calculate Q1 (First Quartile)

Look at values to the LEFT of median (exclude median itself)
Left half: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (5 values)
New n = 5
Position = (5 + 1) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3rd term
Q1 = 5

Step 4: Calculate Q3 (Third Quartile)

Look at values to the RIGHT of median (exclude median itself)
Right half: 12, 15, 18, 20, 25 (5 values)
New n = 5
Position = (5 + 1) / 2 = 3rd term
Q3 = 18

Final Results
For the example dataset:

Q1 = 5 (25th percentile)
Q2 = 10 (50th percentile/median)
Q3 = 18 (75th percentile)

Key Takeaways

Always sort your data first before calculating quartiles
Q2 is the same as the median - it's the middle value of the entire dataset
Q1 is the median of the lower half (excluding the overall median)
Q3 is the median of the upper half (excluding the overall median)
Use the formula (n + 1) / 2 to find the position when n is odd
Quartiles give a much more detailed view of data spread compared to just range

Practical Understanding
Think of quartiles as dividing your class scores into four groups:

Bottom 25% (below Q1)
Lower-middle 25% (Q1 to Q2)
Upper-middle 25% (Q2 to Q3)
Top 25% (above Q3)
