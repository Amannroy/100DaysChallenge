 Median (Measure of Central Tendency)
What is Central Tendency?
When we have a large dataset and want to represent it with a single value, we find the average or "measure of central tendency."
Different types:

Arithmetic Mean
Geometric Mean
Harmonic Mean
Median
Mode


What is Median?
Median = The middle value of a sorted dataset

Also called the 50th percentile
A robust average heavily used in AI/Data Science for data cleaning


How to Calculate Median
Step 1: Always SORT the data first (ascending order)
❌ Without sorting = Wrong answer
Step 2: Check if total values are ODD or EVEN
When ODD number of values:

Formula: (n + 1) / 2 position
Example: 19 values → (19+1)/2 = 10th position
The 10th term is the median (not the value 10, but whatever is at 10th position)

When EVEN number of values:

Find two middle terms: n/2 and (n/2 + 1) positions
Example: 10 values → 5th and 6th terms
Median = Average of these two values (add them and divide by 2)
Note: This median might not actually exist in the dataset!


Worked Examples
Example 1: Even number of values
Data: 23, 65, 18, 12, 40, 15, 21, 18
Step 1 - Sort: 12, 15, 18, 18, 21, 23, 40, 65
Step 2 - Find middle:

Total = 8 values (even)
Middle terms = 4th and 5th positions
4th term = 18, 5th term = 21
Median = (18 + 21) / 2 = 19.5

Example 2: Odd number of values
Data: 42, 25, 20, 72, 4, 51, 6, 18, 31
Step 1 - Sort: 4, 6, 18, 20, 25, 31, 42, 51, 72
Step 2 - Find middle:

Total = 9 values (odd)
Middle position = (9+1)/2 = 5th position
5th term = 25
Median = 25


When to Use Median vs Mean?
Use MEAN when:
✅ Data has few or no outliers
✅ Values are clustered together
✅ Normal distribution
Use MEDIAN when:
✅ Data has outliers (extreme values)
✅ Skewed distribution (left or right)
✅ Garbage/false data points present

Why Median is Better with Outliers
Example with bad data:
Data: 10, 12, 11, 13, 1000

Mean = 209.2 ❌ (completely unrealistic!)
Median = 12 ✅ (represents actual data well)

Real-world example:
Temperature sensor readings: 10, 11, 12, 13, 1000 (sensor error)

Mean = 209.2°C (impossible temperature!)
Median = 12°C (realistic temperature)

Key insight:

Mean is highly sensitive to extreme values
Median is highly resistant to outliers
One garbage data point can shift mean significantly, but median stays stable


Important for AI/Data Science
✅ Median is heavily used in data cleaning
✅ Common interview question topic
✅ Helps identify if data is symmetric or skewed
✅ Critical for handling real-world messy data
Rule of thumb:

Normal distribution → Use Mean
Skewed distribution → Use Median
